Title: Password Generator

This application is able to give numerous options for new passwords chosing different criterias the user would like. The user must chose "yes" to at least one: Numbers, Special Characters, Upper Case Letter, or Lower Case Letter. The user can chose "yes" to more than one of these if they would like. The user also can choose how many characters they want as long as it is >=8 or <=128. If the needed criteria is used, the password generator will provide a random password.
